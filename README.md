# Large-exponents-With-Modulo-operation
Calculate exponents as large as (int)^(10^8), with the modulo operation, in linear time.

This program takes a single O(n) iteration, and fill up the entire array of possible exponents.
And then you can make any number of queries in o(1) time( since the result is pre-computed. )

Thus it is a highly optimised solution for problems where you are required to find the exponent for multiple test cases.

If needed, the return type can be changed to int and p[n] can be returned.
